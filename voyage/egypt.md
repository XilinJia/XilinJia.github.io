Spent ~40 days in one visit

### [Cairo](https://goo.gl/maps/N5jGHH3pyoZ22y4p7)  
Capital and largest city in the country.  The Gisa Pyramids are to the east.

People in Cairo are well cultured, mostly very friendly.  I often heard "welcome to Egypt" while I just walked by someone on the street.  Once, as I was curious about what the drink was at a street stall, a young man bought me one.  I thought he was a student, but he said he was a lawyer.

### [Luxor](https://goo.gl/maps/FfrdmtnzQEeaoXLu5) [(Photos)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/gH7Er5EBAZmd2LAj6)
The city by the Nile in middle of the country with many ancient artifacts, including Luxor Temple, Karnak Temple, Valley of Kings and Valley of Queens.

There are nice Nile cruises from Luxor to Aswan.  I met a family from Cairo with the man as a English professor and the lady retired journalist.  They kindly invited me to dinner in their Cairo home.
