## [Map & Intro](https://goo.gl/maps/Nb4Y1PucVAMZmLm26)

Spent one month in the country.  This unfortunately is the only country giving me bad experience.  Despite of having a 5 months visa to visit three countries all together (Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda), the bad experience in Kenya made me decide to cut the trip and refrain from any similar countries.

A small town not far from Mombasa.  Clearly the most enjoyable place in the country to me.  Calm and Safe.
