This idea was unimaginable, especially when materials like gold or silver were used as money, even when cash was widely used.  Today, money manifests as a number in the bank and becomes less material to most people,  But how can it be spiritual?

To most people, money comes after they perform some work mostly physical or material.  Say one makes shoes.  Every pair of shoes he makes, he earns \$10.  He simply refutes the idea that money is spiritual by saying that he can't get say \$10,000 by desire on the pair of shoes he made.  So it's very natural to associate money with material work.

But he fails to understand as long as he keeps making the same shoe that many people can easily make he's not going to get much more money on the shoe than most other shoe makers get on the same shoe they make.  But he can make some special shoes, or even further, he can do something else from which he can get more money.  Here if this still sounds that money is tied with some material, the idea that sparks on him telling him to transition into doing something new is very spiritual, isn't it?

Say our protagonist has made a very different pair of shoes.  How much can he get from it.  Say he spent \$2 on basic material, \$3 on equipments, and 2 hours in the making.  Say most people like him earns $10 an hour.  So should he price his pair of shoes for \$2 + \$3 + 2 x \$10 = \$25 ?  Or should he add his 10 hours of conception time, which then makes the price to \$125 ?  Most would feel this a reasonable way to do.  But it is very materialistic.

Think from another perspective.  An artist spent 5 days creating a painting.  Would he price his work for 5 times his daily rate of \$200?  There are a lot of workshop artist doing that.  But our artist is a real artist, and he prices his work for \$100,000.  Here, the \$100,000 is purely spiritual.  Will he get it?  Probably and probably not.  That's exactly what spiritual means!  One situation can be that someone really loves the work but doesn't have all the money and offers for \$75,000 instead.  And the deal is made, so the \$75,000 came purely from the mind and is spiritual.  

But the story doesn't stop there.  As the buyer (John) carries the painting going home, someone (Bob) sees the painting and asks how much he bought it for.  John answered \$75,000.  Bob asks if he can pay him \$75,000 for the painting.  Of course John doesn't agree as he loves the painting and there is no reason to sell it for the same price he just bought at.  But Bob really loves the painting too.  He raises the price to \$100,000, no from John, again to \$150,000, still no.  Then he raises to \$200,000.  Although John really loves the painting, thinking a good profit awaits him, so agreed to sell.  So, see here the \$75,000 for the artist, \$125,000 profit for John all comes from the mind and the money is created from the spirit.  Did Bob lose?  No, he gets what he loves which is more important than the \$200,000 that's supposed to serve him exactly on things like this.

Would this apply to our shoe maker?  He is very likely to sell the shoes for \$125 pretty easily, but he also has the chance to sell them for \$1000.  He should understand that it's spiritual.
