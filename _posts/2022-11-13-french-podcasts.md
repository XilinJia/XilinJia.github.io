## For beginners
These are relatively easy, but by no means are for someone at the very beginning level.

### Learn French with daily podcasts <br> Louis French Lessons
These are by the same author.  Each podcast (~3 minutes) analyzes a sentence, explains key words and provides usage examples.  All are read at extremely low speed.  Both have transcripts.

### Learn French by Podcast
In each podcast (~13 minutes) the two hosts slowly go over a short story of certain topic with English explanations.  No transcripts.

## For intermediates

### Little Talk in Slow French
Each (~15 minutes) covers a topic with brief English explanation in between.  No transcripts.

### Journal en Français Facile
This is by rfi, each for 10 minutes talks about news in the world in easy french.  All have transcripts.

### Chose à Savoir <br> Chose à Savoir ART <br> Chose à Savoir CERVEAU <br> Chose à Savoir ÉCONOMIE <br> Chose à Savoir GASTRONOMIE <br> Chose à Savoir HISTOIRE <br> Chose à Savoir SANTE <br> Chose à Savoir SCIENCES <br> Chose à Savoir TECH <br> Incroyable <br> Petits Curieux
This set is excellent.  Each podcast about 2 minutes.  Most have transcripts.

### Learn French Conversation
Some real conversations about 4 minutes each.  No transcripts.

There are more, but I hope these are enough for now.

## Cheers!  Santé!  Prost!
