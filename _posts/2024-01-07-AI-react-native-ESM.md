As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, React Native does not have built-in support for ES Modules (ESM) out of the box. React Native primarily relies on the CommonJS (CJS) module system for handling module imports and exports.

React Native uses the Metro bundler, which is a JavaScript bundler specifically designed for React Native applications. The Metro bundler is configured to handle CommonJS modules and does not natively support ES Modules.

However, there are workarounds and tools available that allow you to use ES Modules in a React Native project:

1. Babel: You can use Babel to transpile your ES Modules to CommonJS modules. Babel is a popular JavaScript transpiler that can transform your code to a compatible format. By configuring Babel with appropriate presets and plugins, you can transpile ES Modules to CommonJS modules that are compatible with React Native.

2. Metro Plugins: Metro, the bundler used by React Native, supports custom plugins. You may find Metro plugins that enable support for ES Modules in React Native. These plugins can modify the bundling process to handle ES Modules or allow you to define your own custom module resolver.

It's important to note that the availability and compatibility of these solutions may change over time as React Native evolves. I recommend consulting the official React Native documentation, community forums, and relevant resources to get the most up-to-date information and guidance on using ES Modules in React Native projects.

Yes, React Native supports ES modules. You can use the import and export statements to import and export modules in your React Native app 1.

Here’s an example of how you can use ES modules in a React Native app:

```
import React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
  );
}
```
In this example, we’re using the import statement to import the React and Text modules from the react and react-native packages, respectively. We’re also using the export statement to export the App component as the default export of the module.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

React Native has partial compatibility with ES modules, but there are key considerations:

1. Native Modules:

CommonJS: React Native's native modules primarily use CommonJS syntax (require() and module.exports).

Direct ES Module Import: You can't directly import ES modules from native modules.

2. JavaScript Runtime:

JavaScriptCore (iOS): Doesn't fully support ES modules.

Hermes (Android): Has better ES module support, but still has limitations.

3. Bundler Configuration:

Metro Bundler: The default React Native bundler has limited ES module support.

Third-Party Bundlers: Webpack or Metro plugins can improve ES module handling, but might require additional setup.

4. Dynamic import():

Supported: React Native supports dynamic import() for lazy loading.

Constraints: Might have performance implications and require careful usage.

5. TypeScript:

Configuration: Set "module": "esnext" or "module": "commonjs" in tsconfig.json to handle ES modules appropriately.

Best Practices:

CommonJS: Stick with CommonJS syntax for core React Native modules and native modules.

Third-Party Libraries: Check compatibility with React Native's module system before using ES modules.

Experiment with Tools: Explore tools like Webpack or Metro plugins for better ES module support, but proceed with caution.

Stay Updated: React Native's ES module support might improve in future versions.

In general, prioritize CommonJS for core React Native development and carefully evaluate ES module usage based on your specific needs and compatibility challenges.

## My understanding

Google Gemini sounds more plausible.
