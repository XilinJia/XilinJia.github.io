I use Xubuntu 22.04 with a regular English-US keyboard.  

To type French or German Text, open Settings->Keyboard->Layout.  On the top of the page, I toggle off "Use system defaults".  Once that's turned off, the greyed-out options are now changeable.  On mine the keyboard layout is "English (US)" and keyboard model is "Generic 105-key PC".  I keep those as they are.  The only thing to change is to choose a Compose key.  I chose "Right Alt" as the compose key.

So when I want to type an accent letter é in French, I first type (not hold) Right Alt key, then type ' then followed by e, and the letter é appears.  

To type à, I first type Right Alt key, then type ` then followed by a, then à appears.  

To type ê, I first type Right Alt key, then type ^ then followed by e, then ê appears.  

For ç, I first type Right Alt key, then type , then followed by c, then ç appears.

For German letter ä, I first type Right Alt key, then type " then followed by a, then ä appears.

Voilà also.
