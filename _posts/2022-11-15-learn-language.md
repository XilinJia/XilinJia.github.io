Learning something comes down to first absorbing the knowledge and then building the ability to use the knowledge.  Specifically, learning a language requires that we 1) learn the words, 2) learn the sentences, and then 3) use the words to make our own sentences.

But a task that can be simply described doesn't mean it can be carried out easily.  If one does it with brute force, and has enough determination, he may find after 10 years of learning, his skill with the language is still so-so.

#### How to get more efficient?

A technique called spaced repetition was introduced in the late 1800s by a German psychologist and proven later in 1970s through research on its usefulness.  The discovery is that as one learns a new thing, the memory fades away after some time.  The more unfamiliar one is with the thing, the faster the memory fades.  So the idea is, so as to not indiscriminately repeat learning the thing but at the same time build a long-term memory of it, it's better to repeat the learning at an interval such that the memory has not totally faded away.

This is a very useful technique.  Say we learn the word "memory".  As we first see it, it's hard to remember, so we repeat it in 4 hours.  As it gets easier, we repeat it in 1 day, even easier, we repeat in 3 days, 6 days, 15 days, 30 days, 90 days, 300 days, an so on.

There are a few apps for Android or iOS to facilitate this process, most notable being Anki.  The user can load up a set of words to the app, then every time he opens the app, he's prompted with one words followed by another.  When he taps "easy" or "hard" on a word, the app automatically schedules the word with the next longer or shorter interval for repeat.

#### What's not so perfect about this?

For words representing simple concept, like "apple" or "car", this is OK.  But for words with complex or abstract meanings, it turns out too crude.  For instance "empathy", from wikitionary:
>Identification with or understanding of the thoughts, feelings, or emotional state of another person. 
>Capacity to understand another person's point of view or the result of such understanding.
>(parapsychology, science fiction) A paranormal ability to psychically read another person's emotions.

When you see this, should you press "easy" because you kinda know the word (but not much about its true meaning), or because you understand its second meaning but not all, or because you understand all the meanings from the definition but have no clue on how it's used?  Note the harder part of comprehending a language is never about understanding the simple words like "apple", it is about these complex or abstract words that present the most challenges.

For small set of words, say 500 words, it's manageable.  For a larger set, say 3000 words (3000 words are hardly the minimum for any language), it becomes very hard to progress as the number of old words required for review on any day becomes overwhelming.

Is there a way to know all the related words of some sorts?  No.

Then how about understanding sentences?  One could load a set of sentences and learn them in the same way.  But it's basically as crude as it gets.  Say you want to mark a sentence as "easy", do you mean you understand the meaning of the sentence (but still can't say it yourself) or you can say it (but still can't write it correctly)?  What if you basically understand a sentence but there are two unfamiliar words in it?  And what about sentences in similar structures but with a couple words replaced?

#### How to deal with these?

My Android app MensLingua took these into considerations.  It helped me learn French (while I was developing it) and after one year and a half, I was able to read 10 French books (~400 pages each).  Check out some more description on [Github](https://github.com/XilinJia/MensLingua)
